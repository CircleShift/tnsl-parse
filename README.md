# tnsl-parse

The tokenizer for the [TNSL Language](https://github.com/CoreChg/tnsl-lang).  Written in Go for the moment.

The goal is to get this part written, and then write a backend for any arch (x86, arm, risc-v, etc.).
After that, work can begin on the real parser which will be written in native TNSL
