# Example tnsl programs

These are working example programs that have been verified to work with the currnet version of the interpreter.  The language is not garunteed to stay constant between the interpreter and the compiled version later down the line (This is all still pre-alpha software).

Current examples:
- basic.tnsl: Simply returns zero

Running examples:

    ./tint -in <path to file> [-flags <args for the program>]
