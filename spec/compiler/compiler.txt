The "compiler" of the TNSL language is formed of several parts, each discussed
in their own file.

	1) Parsing
	
		1a) The tokenizer - chews up .tnsl files and spits out tokens
		1b) The file resolver - interperets import commands and creates a tree of files to compile
		1c) The definer - 
		1d) The AST generator - indexes tokens and provides some rudimentary syntax checking
	
	2) Validation

		2a) The expander - expands pre-processor commands and macrosoperations
		2b) The validator - checks all requirements for all functions and expressions are valid

	3) Translation

		3a) ???
