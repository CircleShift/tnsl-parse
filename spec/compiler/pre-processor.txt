A set of components in the compiler (all before the translator) which expand,
resolve, and validate pre-processor directives into code which can be compiled

Consists of the resolver in the parsor.
The expander and part of the indexer in the validator.

Special (compiler specififc) definitions can be added with _<compiler>_<variable name>

E.X.  if the official implementation wanted to provide the exact time of the compilation, it could use _TNSLC_TIME_NOW for instance
